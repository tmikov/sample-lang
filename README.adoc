== Sample Language

A very simple programming language illustrating lexing, parsing, AST construction and
evaluation. Implemented from scratch during a couple of flights back from JSConf 2015 
(Jacksonville) to San Francisco.

Due to the limited time, it was only intended to illustate the basic principles,
not show production quality code (for example it doesn't exactly free all allocated memory).

The language has C-like syntax and supports variable assignment (only long integer values),
if-then-else conditionals, while loops, function calls, dynamic scoping,
and a foreign function interface.

Examples can be seen in the +examples/+ directory.
